# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
Personal safety concerns are increasing, especially in situations where individuals may be alone, travelling, or exposed to uncertain environments. Traditional safety systems rely heavily on manual alerts, which may not be possible during emergencies. There is a need for an automated system that can intelligently assess risk levels based on environmental and behavioural indicators.  
This project aims to develop a machine learning–based safety alert prototype that predicts whether a situation is “Safe” or requires an “Alert,” based on simulated sensor data.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes:
- Generating synthetic data that represents common safety-related parameters.
- Training ML models to classify situations based on these parameters.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Allowing users to input live values to test safety predictions.
- Presenting basic data visualizations to understand behaviour patterns.

The project does not include real sensor integration, GPS tracking, mobile app deployment, or real-time alert mechanisms, as the purpose is to demonstrate the ML workflow.

## 3. Target Users
- Students learning machine learning concepts.
- Developers creating prototypes for personal safety solutions.
- Researchers working on behavioural modelling or risk prediction.
- Individuals interested in understanding how AI can enhance safety systems.

## 4. High-Level Features
- Synthetic dataset generation for safety risk classification.
- Data preprocessing using encoding and scaling.
- Training and comparison of multiple ML models.
- Prediction system based on user-provided values.
- Visualisations to explore data patterns and class distribution.
- Menu-driven execution for easy navigation.
