# SOS-System: Personal Safety Alert Predictor

## Overview  
SOS-System is a machine learning–based application designed to predict potential personal safety risks. By simulating sensor-like data (time of day, location type, noise level, movement, shake intensity, and keyword detection), the system classifies situations as **Safe** or **Alert**. This prototype demonstrates how AI can assist in creating a personal safety alert mechanism.

## Features  
- Synthetic dataset generation for safety risk modeling  
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding) with pandas and numpy  
- Training of classification models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
- Evaluation of models via accuracy, confusion matrix, and detailed metrics  
- Visualization of data distributions using matplotlib  
- Interactive prediction: enter custom values to test safety risk  

## Technologies Used  
- Python 3  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- matplotlib  
- Standard Python features: functions, loops, user input
